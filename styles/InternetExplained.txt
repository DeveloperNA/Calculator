To understand Networks ,
 think of our college lab computers in which each has a unique file (videos, pictures, apps) ..
 
 so, how are we going to get those files in our devices?

 to accomplish that we need to make our lab computers act as servers to process the file requests which we are going to make.
 
 so, how those servers is going to transfer files to our devices in our home?

 those servers are connected to a super fastest fibre optical cable which is layed underground and under the seas from those servers.

 so, how it is going to reach to my specific device alone ?
	
 Each device has unique IP address so on reaching the server with our device IP address , the server reacts only to those address that recieves.

 But how do we know the IP address of those servers (lab computers) ?

 Here DNS comes to action,in which the browser finds the IP address of respective Domain name that we search on our browser. DNS is like a telephone book. 

 What if, if i need my phones to reach the file?

 Nothing, server simply sends file to the reciever's nearest cell phones towers via fibre optic and those cell towers transfers wirelessly to our device using mobile data.
